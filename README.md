# NeuroCamp Computer Science & Programming Day

## Overall Approach

Briefly introduce computer programming and its connection to neuroscience, and teach the basic fundamentals of computer programming in a one-day short-course.

For the latter, use a neuroscience related dataset and structure CS concept presentation around exploring that data. More on the dataset is in the [dataset README](/data/README.md).

Use a low barrier-to-entry scripting language (Ruby here, but Python would be just as good).

## Session 1: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM

Provide some motivation and an introduction to computer science and how it's connected to neuroscience (mini-lecture).

Cover basic use of the scripting language, and get a file loaded into memory (on the computer).

1. Create and run simple script. (Hello World, with print to console.)
2. Variables and variable access.
3. I/O & load data from file.
4. What functions and modules are (we just used one of each).
5. Loops and iteration.

## Session 2: 1:15 PM - 2:30 PM

Cover some more basic programming constructs, and perform basic processing of the file data.

1. Loops and iteration.
2. Row field access (or, `Dictionary` entry access by key).
3. Conditionals, and template strings for simple output formatting.
4. Math (change in measurement from A to B, percentage).
5. Formatted output to screen.

## Wrap up and review: 2:30 PM - 3:00 PM

* Review what we learned
* Discuss methods to continue exploring computer programming
* Provide resources for further study
