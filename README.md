# NeuroCamp Computer Science & Programming Day

## Overall Approach

Find a neuroscience related dataset and structure CS concept presentation around exploring that data. More on the dataset is in the [dataset README](/data/README.md).

Use a low barrier-to-entry scripting language (Ruby, Python, etc.).

## Session 1: 10 AM - 1 PM

Cover basic use of the scripting language, and get a file loaded into memory.

1. Create and run simple script. (Hello World, with print to console.)
2. Variables and variable access.
3. I/O & load data from file.
4. What functions and modules are (we just used one of each).

## Session 2: 2 PM - 5 PM

Cover basic programming constructs, and perform basic processing of the file data.

1. Loops and iteration.
2. Row field access (or, `Dictionary` entry access by key).
2. Conditionals.
3. Math (change in measurement from A to B, percentage).
4. Formatted output to screen.
