# This sets a variable named `datafile` to have the value `data/data.csv`.
# Variables allow us to save values once for later use. You can think of
# a variable as a named container. When you assign a value to the variable,
# you're putting that value in the container. When you use the variable later,
# you're taking the value out temporarily. Values can be anything: numbers,
# character strings, file objects, lists, and more.
datafile = "data/data.csv"
