# NeuroCamp Computer Science & Programming Day

## Overall Approach

Briefly introduce computer programming and its connection to neuroscience, and teach the basic fundamentals of computer programming in a one-day short-course.

For the latter, use a neuroscience related dataset and structure CS concept presentation around exploring that data. More on the dataset is in the [dataset README](/data/README.md). If there's time, introduce a basic neural net implementation.

Use a low barrier-to-entry scripting language (Python here, but R or possibly Ruby would be good too).

## Session 1: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM

Provide some motivation and an introduction to computer science and how it's connected to neuroscience (mini-lecture).

Cover basic use of the scripting language, and get a file loaded into memory (on the computer).

**To get started, [open this code repository in a jupyter tab.](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/loyno-mathcs/neurocamp_programming/use-notebooks?filepath=index.ipynb).**

1. Introduce the Jupyter Notebook, and run a "Hello World!" program in a notebook.
2. Variables and variable access.
3. I/O & load data from file.
4. What functions and modules are (we just used one of each).
5. Loops and iteration.

## Session 2: 1:15 PM - 2:30 PM

Cover some more basic programming constructs, and perform basic processing of the file data.

1. Row field access (or, `Dictionary` entry access by key).
2. Conditionals, and template strings for simple output formatting.
3. Math (change in measurement from A to B, percentage).
4. Write formatted output to screen.
5. Introduce a more complex program: [implementation of a simple 2-layer neural network](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/loyno-mathcs/neurocamp_programming/use-notebooks?filepath=NeuralNetwork.ipynb).

## Wrap up and review: 2:30 PM - 3:00 PM

* Review what we learned
* Discuss methods to continue exploring computer programming
* Provide resources for further study
