    "For our work, we'll be using the Python language (version 3.7, currently). If you look at the top right of the window, you should see \"Python 3\". This is the language indicator, and shows you what language the file is expected to use.\n",

    "At the top left of this pane, you'll see the toolbar. That lets you control what's happening in the file and within the current cell. Most importantly, the right-most dropdown allows you to change a cell from \"Markdown\" explanatory text mode to \"Code\" Python programming mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, we use Python 3's built-in `print` function to write \"Hello, World!\" to the output console (displayed below the cell when it is run). We'll talk more about functions later. For now, just make sure you understand the mechanics of how the notebook interface works.\n",

    "One thing we do frequently when writing programs is create variables to store data in memory that we can retrieve later. You can think of a variable as a box in which you put a piece of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can have different types: text (called \"strings\"), numbers (which can be \"integer\", \"float\", \"double\" and more), true/false (called \"boolean\") and more. We can also put structured and hierarchical data, such as lists, mappings (called \"Dictionaries\") and more, into variables. We'll see some of those later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages require a different kind of box for each type of data you might want to put in. Python is gentler and allows us to put arbitrary types of data into the same variable. However, once you put a type of data into the variable, Python expects you to follow the rules of that type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, we're creating a couple string variable and then printing their values. Notice that the `print` function can accept variables representing the text (\"string\" value) to be written to the output.\n",
