    "One thing we do frequently when writing programs is create variables to store data in memory that we can retrieve later. You can think of a \"variable\" as a box in which you put a piece of data called a \"value\".\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* text (called \"strings\")\n",
    "* numbers (which can be \"integer\", \"float\", \"double\" and more)\n",
    "* true/false (called \"boolean\")\n",
    "* other types of single values\n",
    "* structured and hierarchical data, such as lists, mappings (called \"Dictionaries\") and more (We'll see some of those later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages require a different kind of box for each type of data you might want to put in. Python is gentler and allows us to put arbitrary types of data into the same variable. However, once you put a type of data into the variable, Python expects you to follow the rules of that type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, we're creating a couple string variables and then printing their values. Notice that the `print` function can accept variables representing the text (\"string\" value) to be written to the output.\n",

    "**Once again, you should play with the code below and see if you can change the variable values.**"
